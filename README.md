First, download and install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) if they're not already installed.

You can check by running the following in the terminal. If it responds with version numbers, they're already installed.

```bash
node -v
# and then
yarn -v
```

Next, install the javascript dependencies for this project by opening the terminal `cd`ing to this directory and running `yarn`. Hint: You can type `cd` and then drag the directory to the terminal window, and it'll paste the path there, so you can just hit enter.

Once that's done, run

```bash
yarn start
```

And go to `[http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234)` in your browser or [click here](http://localhost:1234)
